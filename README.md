# Assessing Effects of Various Parameters on Fuel Efficiency

This report focuses on exploring how various variables can affect fuel effiecient in different cars and tries to explore if there's a significant difference between automatic and manual transmission. Statistical analysis and regression modeling was used to quantify this. 

To summarise the findings, it is found that manual transmissions on average does a little better than automatic transmission but it statistically difficult to draw this conclusion. But weight and cylinders variables were seen to be significantly affecting the fuel effieciency (mpg) the mostout of all the variable and were considered as counfounding variable while finding the effects of transmission on fuel effieciency.
